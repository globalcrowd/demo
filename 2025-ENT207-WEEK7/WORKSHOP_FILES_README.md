## ⚠️ Disclaimer Notes

The disclaimer appears:
1. **Prominently at the top of index.html**
2. **On every guide page** (yellow banner)
3. **States clearly:**
   - AI-generated content
   - For orientation, not definitive reference
   - Cannot fact-check everything
   - Verify with official docs

This sets appropriate expectations while still being educational!
