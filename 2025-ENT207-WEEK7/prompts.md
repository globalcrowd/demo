## üéØ Understanding Prompts

### What is a Prompt?
A prompt is a set of instructions you give to an AI (like Claude Code or ChatGPT) to tell it exactly what you want it to do. Think of it like giving instructions to a very talented but literal assistant.

### Why Prompts Matter
- **Good prompts** = AI builds exactly what you need, first try
- **Vague prompts** = AI guesses and might build the wrong thing
- **Detailed prompts** = Faster development, fewer bugs

### Anatomy of a Good Prompt
```
1. WHAT you want to build (the goal)
2. HOW it should work (technical details)
3. WHAT it should look like (design/output)
4. WHAT to include (specific features or libraries)
```

## üöÄ Main Prompt: Creating the Django App

### Purpose
This prompt tells the AI coding agent to build a complete web application that:
- Accepts image uploads from users
- Sends images to an AI vision service
- Displays analysis results

### When to Use
- At the start of your project
- When you want to build the entire application from scratch

### The Prompt

```
Create a Django web application called "smartvision" that allows users to upload images and get AI-powered analysis.

Requirements:
- Simple, modern upload interface with drag-and-drop support
- Send uploaded image to Google Gemini Vision API (gemini-1.5-flash model)
- Prompt to send to Gemini: "Analyze this image in detail. Describe: 1) What objects you see, 2) The context/setting, 3) Three potential use cases for this image in a mobile app (e-commerce, social, utility, etc.)"
- Display Gemini's response in a formatted card with nice typography
- Show the uploaded image alongside the analysis
- Use Django 4.2 and google-generativeai Python package
- Include proper error handling (API failures, unsupported file types)
- Add comments explaining the code flow
- Style with modern CSS (gradients, shadows, responsive design)
- Show a loading spinner while processing

Technical notes:
- Use Django's FileSystemStorage for temporary file handling
- API key should be read from environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY
- Support JPG, PNG, WEBP formats
- Limit file size to 5MB
```

### üìù Student Notes: Why Each Part Matters

**"Create a Django web application called 'smartvision'"**
‚Üí Tells AI which framework to use (Django) and what to name it

**"Simple, modern upload interface with drag-and-drop"**
‚Üí Defines user experience - not just a boring button

**"Send uploaded image to Google Gemini Vision API"**
‚Üí Specifies WHICH AI service (important - different APIs have different code)

**"Prompt to send to Gemini: 'Analyze this image...'"**
‚Üí This is a "system prompt" - instructions for the AI vision model

**"Display Gemini's response in a formatted card"**
‚Üí Makes results look professional, not just plain text

**"API key should be read from environment variable"**
‚Üí Security best practice - never hardcode API keys in code!

**"Support JPG, PNG, WEBP formats"**
‚Üí Defines constraints - helps catch errors early

## üß† System Prompt: Image Analysis Instructions

### What is a System Prompt?
A system prompt is the instruction YOU send to the AI vision service (like Gemini) telling it HOW to analyze the image. It's different from the prompt you give Claude Code.

### Flow Diagram
```
You ‚Üí Claude Code (builds the app)
         ‚Üì
    Django App ‚Üí Gemini API (analyzes image)
         ‚Üì
    System Prompt: "Analyze this image and describe..."
```

### Basic System Prompt (General Analysis)

```
Analyze this image in detail. Describe:
1) What objects you see
2) The context/setting
3) Three potential use cases for this image in a mobile app
```

**Why this works:**
- Numbered list = structured response
- "In detail" = AI doesn't give one-word answers
- "Potential use cases" = makes it practical for students' projects

### Alternative System Prompts (For Different Use Cases)

#### Product E-commerce
```
You are a product catalog AI. Analyze this product image and provide:
- Product category
- Key features visible
- Suggested product title
- Estimated condition (new/used/damaged)
- Suggested price range in USD
- 5 SEO keywords for listing
```

#### Food/Recipe App
```
Analyze this food image and provide:
- Main dish/ingredient identification
- Cuisine type
- Suggested recipe name
- Key ingredients visible
- Dietary tags (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)
```

#### Fashion/Clothing App
```
Analyze this clothing/outfit image:
- Clothing type and style
- Colors present
- Occasion/setting (casual, formal, sportswear)
- Season suitability
- Suggested outfit pairings
```

#### Document/Text Extraction
```
Extract all text from this image. If it's a form or document:
- Identify document type
- Extract key fields (names, dates, amounts)
- Highlight any important information
- Note if anything is unclear or unreadable
```

### üéì Teaching Moment: How to Write Good System Prompts

**Bad System Prompt:**
```
Tell me about this image.
```
‚Üí Too vague! AI might give you anything.

**Good System Prompt:**
```
You are an expert art curator. Analyze this artwork and describe:
1. Art style and period
2. Dominant colors and mood
3. Subject matter
4. Estimated value range if known
```
‚Üí Specific role, clear structure, defined output!

**Key Principles:**
1. **Be specific** - Tell AI what you want, not what you don't want
2. **Give structure** - Use numbered lists or bullet points
3. **Define output format** - JSON? Plain text? Bullet points?
4. **Set context** - "You are a [expert]..." helps AI respond appropriately

## üîÑ Iteration Prompts: Adding Features

### Purpose
After you have a working basic app, use these prompts to add more features one at a time.

### Prompt 1: Save Analysis History

```
Modify the application to:
- Save the last 10 uploaded images and their AI analysis results to SQLite database
- Display them in a gallery below the upload form
- Each gallery item shows: thumbnail, analysis snippet, timestamp
- Add a "Delete" button for each saved item
- Use Django models to store: image file path, analysis text, upload date
```

**What students learn:** Database integration, data persistence

### Prompt 2: Compare Two Images

```
Add a "Compare Mode" feature:
- User can select 2 previously uploaded images from the gallery
- Add a "Compare" button that sends both images to Gemini
- System prompt for comparison: "Compare these two images. Describe similarities, differences, and which would be better for [e-commerce product listing]"
- Display comparison side-by-side with images
```

**What students learn:** Multi-image processing, UI state management

### Prompt 3: Add User Authentication

```
Add user authentication to the app:
- Use Django's built-in authentication system
- Users must register/login to upload images
- Each user sees only THEIR uploaded images
- Add a simple profile page showing upload count
- Style the login/register pages to match the main app design
```

**What students learn:** User management, data isolation

### Prompt 4: Export Results to PDF

```
Add a "Download Report" feature:
- Create a button on each analysis result
- Generate a PDF report containing: uploaded image, full analysis text, timestamp, your app branding
- Use ReportLab library for PDF generation
- Style the PDF professionally with headers and formatting
```

**What students learn:** File generation, third-party libraries

### Prompt 5: Add Real-time Processing Indicator

```
Improve the user experience:
- Replace simple loading spinner with a progress indicator
- Show status messages: "Uploading image...", "Sending to AI...", "Processing results..."
- Use JavaScript fetch API with progress events
- Add animations for each stage
```

**What students learn:** Frontend interactivity, async operations

## üêõ Debugging Prompts

### When Code Doesn't Run

```
I'm getting this error when running the Django app:
[paste the error message here]

The error occurs when [describe what you were doing].
Can you explain what's wrong and how to fix it?
```

### When API Calls Fail

```
The app runs but the API call to Gemini fails with this error:
[paste error]

Here's my current code:
[paste the relevant view function]

My GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment. What could be wrong?
```

### When Styling Looks Broken

```
The upload form displays but the CSS styling isn't working correctly. The page looks like [describe the problem].

Can you check the CSS and fix the layout to ensure:
- The upload area is centered
- The form is responsive on mobile
- Colors match the gradient theme
```

### When Features Don't Work As Expected

```
I added the [feature name] but it's not working as expected. Instead of [expected behavior], it's [actual behavior].

Can you review the code and suggest fixes?
```

## üîå API-Specific Notes

### Google Gemini API

**API Key Setup:**
```bash
# In terminal/command prompt
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Or in .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Python Code Pattern:**
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY'))
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

# For images
response = model.generate_content([
    "Your system prompt here",
    {"mime_type": "image/jpeg", "data": base64_image_data}
])
```

**Free Tier:** 1,500 requests per day
**Best for:** Students, demos, prototypes

---

### OpenAI Vision API (GPT-4 Vision)

**API Key Setup:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

**Python Code Pattern:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Your system prompt here"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"}}
        ]
    }]
)
```

**Pricing:** Pay per use (~$0.01 per image)
**Best for:** Production apps, high accuracy needs

---

### DeepSeek Vision API (If Available)

**Status:** As of early 2025, vision capabilities through DeepSeek-VL2 model
**Note:** API access may be limited or through third-party platforms

**If you have access:**
```python
# DeepSeek uses OpenAI-compatible format
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv('DEEPSEEK_API_KEY'),
    base_url="https://api.deepseek.com"
)

# Similar usage to OpenAI
```

**Why we're NOT using it today:**
- Unclear API access for vision features
- Recent stability issues reported
- Limited documentation for vision endpoints

## üéì Key Concepts for Students

### 1. Prompt Engineering is a Skill
Writing good prompts is like writing good requirements. The better your prompt, the better your code.

### 2. Iteration is Normal
You won't get perfect code on the first try. Use iteration prompts to refine features.

### 3. System Prompts vs Code Prompts
- **Code prompt** ‚Üí Instructions for Claude/ChatGPT to write code
- **System prompt** ‚Üí Instructions sent TO the AI vision API in your code

### 4. API Keys are Secrets
Never commit API keys to GitHub! Always use environment variables.

### 5. Different APIs, Same Pattern
All vision APIs follow similar patterns:
1. Send image (as URL or base64)
2. Send text prompt
3. Receive structured response

The code syntax differs, but the CONCEPT is identical.

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Your Week 11 Project

1. **Start with the basic prompt** - Get something working first
2. **Test with multiple images** - Different lighting, angles, quality
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - What if API is down? Show user a nice message
4. **Consider rate limits** - Don't spam the API, add delays between requests
5. **Document your prompts** - Save the system prompts you use in a file

### Questions to Ask Yourself

Before writing a prompt:
- What EXACTLY do I want the AI to build/do?
- What libraries or tools should it use?
- What should the output look like?
- What errors might occur and how should they be handled?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå "Make me an app with AI"
‚Üí Too vague!

‚úÖ "Create a Flask app that uses OpenAI Vision API to analyze product photos and suggest titles"

‚ùå "Fix my code"
‚Üí Doesn't provide context!

‚úÖ "I'm getting a 401 error when calling the API. Here's my code [paste]. My API key is set. What's wrong?"
